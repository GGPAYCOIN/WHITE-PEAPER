🔶 **GGPAY Decentralized Gold Loan – Summary**

**GGPAY** is a **non-custodial, DeFi-based gold loan protocol** built on **GG CHAIN**, enabling users to unlock instant liquidity by depositing **tokenized physical gold (GG-GOLD)** as collateral.

---

🟡 **Core Model**

* **Custody:** Fully non-custodial, smart-contract controlled

---

🔁 **Auto EMI Recovery via Gold Burn**

* EMI is auto-calculated at loan issuance.
* If EMI is **not paid on time**, the protocol:
