GGPAY COIN – Staking Reward Distribution (Whitepaper Section)
Overview
The GGPAY Coin staking model is designed to reward long-term holders through a transparent,
sustainable, and automated reward distribution mechanism powered by GG CHAIN smart
contracts. Rewards depend on staking duration and the percentage of rewards already withdrawn
(self-staking + team/referral income combined).
Base Example
Stake Amount: 100 GGPAY Coins
Maximum combined return cap considered: 20%, 50%, 80%
Rewards calculated monthly and distributed daily.
Reward Tier – After 20% Total Reward Achieved
1 Year Staking: 2% per month (0.06 GGPAY per day)
2 Year Staking: 3% per month
3 Year Staking: 6% per month
Reward Tier – After 50% Total Reward Withdrawn
1 Year Staking: 1.5% per month
2 Year Staking: 2% per month
3 Year Staking: 4% per month
Reward Tier – After 80% Total Reward Withdrawn
1 Year Staking: 1% per month
2 Year Staking: 1.5% per month
3 Year Staking: 3% per month
Reward Calculation Formula
Daily Reward = (Staked Amount × Monthly Reward %) ÷ 30
Smart Contract Rules
• Staked principal remains locked for the selected duration
• Reward rate auto-adjusts based on withdrawal percentage
• Rewards are non-compounding by default
• All calculations are transparent and on-chain
Governance
DAO governance may adjust reward rates, caps, and referral contribution ratios through on-chain
voting mechanisms.
This staking system ensures fairness, long-term sustainability, and strong incentives for genuine
GGPAY Coin holders.
