GGPAY GOLD – Whitepaper
1 GGPAY GOLD = 1 Gram of 24K Physical Gold

1. Abstract
GGPAY GOLD is a blockchain-based, gold-backed digital asset built on GG CHAIN, 
designed to merge the timeless value of physical gold with the speed, transparency,
and accessibility of decentralized finance. 
Each GGPAY GOLD (GGPAYG) token is directly backed by 1 gram of certified
24-karat gold stored in audited and insured vaults.

2. Introduction
Gold has been a trusted store of value for centuries. However, traditional gold
trading is slow, costly, 
and geographically limited. GGPAY GOLD transforms gold ownership through
tokenization on GG CHAIN, making it possible to store, 
transfer, and redeem gold anywhere, instantly, and without intermediaries.

3. Problem Statement
Traditional gold investments face challenges such as high storage and insurance
costs, 
slow cross-border transfers, counterfeit and fraud risks, and lack of transparent
auditing. 
These problems make gold less efficient as a modern financial instrument.

4. The GGPAY GOLD Solution
GGPAY GOLD solves these challenges by tokenizing physical gold (1 GGPAYG = 1
gram), 
ensuring GG CHAIN transparency, enabling instant transfers, allowing physical
redemption, and implementing quarterly audits.

5. How It Works
Gold Acquisition → Vault Storage → Token Minting → Transparency & Audits →
Redemption. 
Each step ensures complete 1:1 gold backing and global transferability.

Insured, and Borderless.
